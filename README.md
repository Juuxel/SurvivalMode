# Survival Mode

Minecraft Classic had [a test for the survival game mode](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Java_Edition_Survival_Test)
available between versions 0.24 and 0.27. While the later Classic versions were creative-only,
code for the survival mode still remained in the game internally.

**Survival Mode** re-enables survival mode on 0.30 using the game's "hidden" implementation.
The mod is released as a jar built against obfuscated names for 0.30, so it won't work for other creative versions after 0.27.
